[[retry]]
== Retry Policy

In order to recover from a brief network glitch, `@Retry` can be used to invoke the same operation again.
The `Retry` policy allows to configure :

* `maxRetries`: the maximum retries
* `delay`: delays between each retry
* `delayUnit`: the delay unit
* `maxDuration`: maximum duration to perform the retry for.
* `durationUnit`: duration unit
* `jitter`: the random vary of retry delays
* `jitterDelayUnit`: the jitter unit
* `retryOn`: specify the failures to retry on
* `abortOn`: specify the failures to abort on
* `backoffDelayFactor` : defines the factor to use to increase delay between retries
* `backoffMaxDelay` : maximum delay when backoff retry is used

=== Retry usage

`@Retry` can be applied to the class or method level.
If applied to a class, it means the all methods in the class will have the `@Retry` policy applied.
If applied to a method, it means  that method will have `@Retry` policy applied.
If the `@Retry` policy applied on a class level and on a method level within that class, the method level `@Retry` will override the class-level `@Retry` policy for that particular method.
Backoff retry can be used to exponentially increase delay between every retry.

    * 3200ms before fourth one and 4000ms before fifth and subsequent retries since backoff max delay is 4000ms
    */

----

The `@Retry` annotation can be used together with `@Fallback`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Asynchronous`, `@Bulkhead` and `@Timeout`.
A `@Fallback` can be specified and it will be invoked if the `@Retry` still fails.

If `@Retry` is used with `@Timeout`, a retry will only be triggered if `TimeoutException` or one of its super classes are defined in the `retryOn` attribute of the `@Retry`.
